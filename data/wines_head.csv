The best Saint-Émilion wines will exhibit a terrific mineral vein, the result of vines being planted on the region's limestone escarpment. Vines planted on sandy soils tend to produce grapes that make lighter styled wines.

Situated on the right bank of Bordeaux, the region of Saint-Émilion can boast of producing the most diverse range of styles, partly due to differences in soil types, from gravel to limestone to sand, but also thanks to production variations and winemakers looking to make their mark."

Champagne has long been the wine of choice to celebrate special occasions, and its reputation as a luxury beverage has been intact since the Romans established vineyards in Reims in the 5th century (that's a really long time ago). 

Sparkling Champagne wasn't discovered until the 16th century, by accident, by the Benedictine Monks. Early vintages of Champagne were dubbed “the devil's wine” because the bottles tended to explode. Improvements to both bottle and cork developed over hundreds of years. 

Champagne is mainly made from a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier grapes, and most of it is produced as a non-vintage wine, meaning that it's a blend of several vintages. Generally speaking, non-vintage Champagne is fantastic, and tends to be less expensive than vintage Champagne—this is because a vintage year is only declared when growing conditions are especially favorable. 

The convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made. Following primary fermentation and bottling, a secondary alcoholic fermentation is induced in the bottle, which is achieved by the addition of yeast and rock sugar. The bubbles we love so much are a natural byproduct of this magical secondary fermentation, in the form of carbon dioxide."

It has been flourishing madly since the 1960s, although it was first cultivated in the 1800s. 

Californian Cabernet Sauvignon is dry and full-bodied, and displays the grape's signature green flavors like bell pepper, dark fruits like blackberrry, with touches of eucalyptus and mint. These Cali versions tend to also show earth, dusty notes, mocha, and cedar. 

The moderate to high tannin levels and concentrated flavors in Californian Cab make it a sensational food wine. It's superb with porterhouse steak, braised pork belly, hearty lamb stews, portobello mushrooms and grilled burgers."

This area is known for making clean, light, white wines that are refreshing.

You will not find many famous grapes grown in this region, but you will find some great values.

Italian white wines can be very frustrating and confusing. They do not make many wines from grapes that most people are familiar with. However, some of the local grapes that are used can make wines that are elegant, refreshing, and fun.

A lot of the really great white wines from Central Italy are going to be simple and light. They do not have a ton of strong fruit flavors, but can often produce subtly beautiful flavors of tart stone fruits, white flowers, and often almonds.

Keep your eyes open for the underrated wines of Verdicchio di Matelica or Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi."

Often times Saint-Julien can be mistaken for Pauillac; however, rarely do Saint-Julien wines match their intense concentration."
